**BirthYaY â€“ Strides: Older, Bolder.**

As custom dictates, I will jot down a few things for my birthday this year. We are getting bolder, and unapologetically ourselves.

As I celebrate another trip around the sun, I find myself pausing to reflect on the woman I am becoming, acknowledging both my strides and weaknesses with a sense of pride and humility. I realised birthdays have a unique way of prompting introspection, inviting one to evaluate their journey while eagerly not forgetting to anticipate the adventures that lie ahead.
With each passing year, I have learned to embrace the essence of growthâ€”the subtle yet profound changes that shape oneâ€™s character and perspective. I must admit I stumbled, faltered, and faced challenges that tested my resilience, but through it all, Iâ€™ve emerged stronger and more resilient than before. These moments of struggle have become invaluable lessons, reminding me of my capacity for perseverance and adaptation.

Yet, alongside my achievements, I am also keenly aware of my imperfections, the areas where I still have room to grow. While acknowledging that these weaknesses arenâ€™t limitations but opportunities for self-improvement and personal development, Iâ€™m embracing authenticity and fostering a deeper connection with myself and those around me.

Standing at the threshold of a new year, I greet it with open arms, filled with hope and anticipation for the beautiful new season ahead. With each dawn comes the promise of fresh beginnings, the opportunity to set new goals, and the chance to continue evolving into the best version of myself. I carry with me the lessons of the past, the dreams of the future, and the gratitude for the present moment.


So here is to another year of growth, of challenges met with courage, of dreams pursued with determination, and of love shared with an open heart. May this birthday be a celebration of the journeyâ€”the highs and lows, the triumphs and tribulationsâ€”that have shaped me into the woman I am today. And as I blow out the candles, I make a wish for the year ahead: may it be filled with joy, laughter, and endless opportunities for growth and fulfillment.


And so this year, here are a few pointers from the past year that I would be doomed if I didnâ€™t mention:

* Walk alone if you must. Honey, on certain journeys, you will have to go solo. The obstacles and hurdles will be there. You may wish you had not started down that road, but soon you will realize why it was necessary to do what you did.

* Be mindful of who stands in your corner. This past year has underscored the importance of cherishing those select individuals who would unhesitatingly stand by you in times of adversity. No. Scratch that. Who are those people who would truly take a bullet for you?

* You will win. But when you donâ€™t, you learn. Treat those losses as lessons. You are not any lesser when battles are lost. Just stay on the watch for when you must celebrate even the least of victories.

* People come. They go. An old friend once told me to never trust anyone. I believed them. Babe, folks wonâ€™t always stay even when you need them to. However, even during the times when they stay, know when it is necessary to rather not have them.


* What is meant to be yours will be. Honey, do not fret if that job offer slipped through your fingers or if that dream man just got engaged last month. Learn to wait for what is meant to be yours as it will come regardless.

* Learn in every circumstance you find yourself. If an opportunity to learn a new skill, art, or even gain new knowledge presents itself, grab it like your life depends on it. You do not lose anything from becoming a little more skillful. If you are still wondering whether to take on that IT lesson, then here is your green light.


* Celebrate yourself. The only person who is going to remember to celebrate you at the end of the day is YOU. Take yourself on that trip if you want. Buy that dress if you want. Just do not let anyone tell you how best to celebrate yourself.

* Put yourself first. Selfish they may call you. Turn a deaf ear to that and focus on how to better yourself. After all, they may never recall how much you sacrificed for them, but how you failed to share the little that was left of you.

* Be thankful. Do not forget to express gratitude in both the good and bad days. At least I have learned to give thanks even when the dark clouds linger and the cold winters slither in.

* Do not look for love. It will always find you. Those long quests for love, wishing, and hoping, might never be enough. When you least need it, least expect it, that is when it comes creeping in.

* We try again tomorrow. Every dawn brings an opportunity to try again. We simply donâ€™t give up. Babe, here we fight, we strive, we endure, we press on.


That said, I wish all the Pisces a happy birthday. Youâ€™re truly amazing and beautiful. Shout out to my friends Lucy and Herman, the amazing ex Joe and Kilion (my little bro) who share the birthday month with me. Here is to us!

Happy birthday to the bravest and strongest fighter. All I have achieved is amazing and I am certain I am a perfect example of how important it is to believe in oneself. Congrats to me!

Another phase in life, another stage of excellence and another opportunity for growth. I am more than grateful to be alive. Happy birthday to me!


Happy Birthday to me, and hereâ€™s to the beautiful adventure that awaits! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚
